# Minimum Cost A* Algorithm

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a mimimum cost path finding algorithm.

# Collaborators:
Jacob Yealy  
Caden Rosenberry

# Instructions
To run the program, ensure that you have a local csv with valid nodes.  
The csv should be arranged in such an order that:
* First node: From node.
* Second node: To node.
* Third node: Cost of taking the path from the first to the second node.
