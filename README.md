# Minimum Cost A* Algorithm

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create the A* and IDA* mimimum cost path finding algorithms.

# Collaborators:

Caden Rosenberry

# Instructions
To run the program, ensure that your CSV is local and type "python3 main.py"  
The csv should be arranged in such an order that:
* First node: From node.
